# Remove [Starship](https://starship.rs/) from [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) based distros

## Remove all dependencies and remaining files from Starship

<br />
<br />

To `run` use:

```bash
chmod +x remove-starship.py
sudo ./remove-starship.py

or 

sudo python3 remove-starship.py
```

`SUDO` is needed, without superuser access we can't remove some files and starship configs
